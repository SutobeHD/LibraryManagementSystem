## Lifecycle

- 2026-05-15 — `research/idea_` — scaffolded from auth-audit adjacent findings

## Problem

`app/main.py:558` accepts user-controlled `path` and runs `subprocess.run(["explorer", "/select,", path])`. Positional (not `shell=True`) → command injection hard. But: zero path validation. Authenticated caller can ask explorer to navigate anywhere on disk — including `%APPDATA%` with the new `.session-token` file, user home, network shares. UI-driven recon primitive. Need: `validate_audio_path`-equivalent sandbox for reveal, restrict target to `ALLOWED_AUDIO_ROOTS`, reject if file extension not in audio allowlist, log refused attempts at WARN.
