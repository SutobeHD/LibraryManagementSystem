# <same as title>

> **Caveman+ style.** Fragments, bullets. Drop articles/filler/hedges. No prose paragraphs.
> Word caps are **soft** — recommendations, not hard blocks. Exceed when topic complexity demands; routines may flag excess length but never truncate facts.
> State = folder + filename prefix (not frontmatter). Lifecycle = audit trail. See `../README.md`.
> Routines advance this doc **autonomously** by state. **One** user gate: `approvalgate_` — read `## Approval Summary` + `## Mockup`, then `/approve` or `/reject`. After approval you test the finished branch locally and merge it yourself.
> Section ownership: each `> ↓ Stage X — <agent>: …` marker names the agent that fills the section. Don't write into a section before its stage.

## Lifecycle

- YYYY-MM-DD — `research/idea_` — created

## Original Idea (verbatim — never edit)

<!--
Written ONCE by the user. 1–3 sentences, raw. NEVER edited after — not by routines, not by the user.
Every verifier (Stage 1 idea-check, Stage 2 research-check, Stage 3 plan-review, Stage 4 doc-sync) checks
its work against this block. It is the anchor against scope-creep and misreading.
-->

…

---

> ↓ Stage 1 — `drafting_`. `research-draft` fills Problem → Research Plan via 4 agents (Scout, Prior-Art, Risk-Surface, Worker). Verifier fills Idea Verification.

## Prior Art

Stage 1 Prior-Art-Agent. Adjacent shipped / explored / abandoned work. ≤120 words. Link by slug (relative path).

- **Shipped:** [implemented_<slug>_<date>](../archived/implemented_<slug>_<date>.md) — what it covers, what it doesn't
- **Active research:** [<state>_<slug>](../research/<state>_<slug>.md) — overlap, conflict?
- **Superseded / abandoned:** [<archived>](../archived/…) — why it didn't ship; lessons
- **External precedent:** rekordbox/serato/traktor/library-manager behavior — cite source

If no prior art: **"None — greenfield."**

## Problem

Stage 1 Worker. ≤60 words (soft). What / why / cost-of-not-doing.

## Goals / Non-goals

**Goals**
- …

**Non-goals**
- …

## Constraints

Stage 1 Worker + Risk-Surface-Agent. External facts bounding solution. Cite source per bullet.

- **External APIs / rate limits:** …
- **Data shape (`master.db`, ANLZ, USB PDB):** … (cite `file:line` invariant if applicable)
- **Schicht-A pinning / library version:** … (cite `requirements.txt:N` or `Cargo.toml:N`)
- **Perf / capacity:** … (latency budget, memory ceiling)
- **Legal / compliance:** … (license, GDPR, region)
- **Concurrency invariants:** `_db_write_lock`, `validate_audio_path`, `SafeAnlzParser` if relevant

## Dependencies

Stage 1 Risk-Surface-Agent. New libs / external services / hardware required. Each row sized for a Schicht-A audit decision.

| Dep | Kind | Version | License | Schicht-A audit needed? | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| <name> | py / npm / cargo / system | X.Y.Z | MIT/BSD/… | yes/no | <one-line reason> |

If none: **"None — uses existing stack only."**

## Open Questions

Stage 1 Worker. Numbered. Each resolvable (yes/no or X vs Y), not philosophy. Each becomes a parallel research agent in Stage 2.

1. …

## Research Plan

Stage 1 Worker. ≤120 words (soft). Which aspects Stage 2 researches in parallel — one bullet per agent. Drives the autonomous explore stage; phrase each bullet so two parallel agents (codebase + web) could split it.

- Agent 1 (codebase + web): …
- Agent 2 (codebase + web): …

## Idea Verification

Stage 1 Verifier. Dated entries, append-only. PASS / FAIL + ≤40-word reason (checked vs `## Original Idea` + `## Prior Art`).

### YYYY-MM-DD — <PASS|FAIL>
- …

---

> ↓ Stage 2 — `exploring_` (autonomous; no user gate). On Idea-Verifier PASS, `research-draft` advances `drafting_` → `exploring_` directly. `research-explore` runs parallel tiered agents (codebase + web + synthesis per OQ), an Adversarial agent, a Citation-Quality verifier, and a Research-Verifier — one autonomous pass to `evaluated_`.

## Findings / Investigation

Stage 2 Synthesis-Agents (one per OQ). Dated subsections, append-only. ≤150 words each (soft). Never edit past entries — supersede.

### YYYY-MM-DD — <label>
- **Codebase:** … (`file:line` refs required)
- **Web:** … (cited URLs required)
- **Synthesis:** …
- **Confidence:** high / medium / low

## Adversarial Findings

Stage 2 Adversarial-Agent (phase 2). Devil's-advocate — what could go wrong, what assumptions are weak, what dependencies betray us. ≤120 words. Append-only.

### YYYY-MM-DD
- **Weak assumption:** …
- **Failure mode:** …
- **Counter-example:** …

If none survive scrutiny: **"No surviving objections — proceed with caution flags above."**

## Citation Quality

Stage 2 Citation-Verifier (phase 2). Checks every `file:line` ref + URL in `## Findings` exists + says what the Finding claims. PASS / FAIL list. ≤80 words.

### YYYY-MM-DD — <PASS|FAIL>
- PASS: Findings 1, 2, 4 — citations verified
- FAIL: Finding 3 — `app/main.py:123` no such symbol, replace or remove

---

> ↓ Stage 2 phase 2 (autonomous; no user gate) — `research-explore` deepens findings, runs Adversarial + Citation verifiers, then the Research-Verifier gates the whole body before Options-Synthesis advances the doc to `evaluated_`.

## Research Verification

Stage 2 wave-2 verifier over whole research body. ≤120 words. PASS → `evaluated_`; gaps → more Findings.

### YYYY-MM-DD — <PASS|GAPS>
- Coverage of Open Questions: …
- Internal consistency: …
- Citation quality (cross-ref `## Citation Quality`): …
- Adversarial concerns addressed: …

## Options Considered

Stage 2 Synthesis-Agent (phase 2 PASS). Per option: sketch ≤5 bullets, pros, cons, S/M/L/XL, risk, prior-art match.

### Option A — <name>
- Sketch:
- Pros:
- Cons:
- Effort:
- Risk:
- Prior-art match: <slug or "novel">

### Option B — <name>
- Sketch:
- Pros:
- Cons:
- Effort:
- Risk:
- Prior-art match: <slug or "novel">

## Recommendation

Stage 2 Synthesis-Agent (phase 2 PASS). ≤120 words. Which option + what blocks commit + which OQ each Finding answers.

---

> ↓ Stage 3 — `implement/draftplan_`. `research-plan` fills Implementation Plan + Task Queue via 5 agents (Planner, Threat-Modeller, Migration, Perf-Budget, Test-Plan). Reviewer fills Review. On Review PASS, the Mockup+Summary-Agent fills `## Approval Summary` + `## Mockup`, then advances to `approvalgate_`.

## Implementation Plan

Stage 3 Planner-Agent. Concrete enough that someone else executes without re-deriving.

### Scope
- **In:** …
- **Out:** …

### Step-by-step
1. …

### Files touched
Path + role (read / edit / new):
- `<path>` — <role> — <why>

### Testing
High-level (see `## Test Plan` for concrete pytest/cargo cases):
- …

### Risks & rollback
- …

## Threat Model

Stage 3 Threat-Modeller-Agent. Required when feature touches: auth, `require_session`, filesystem (paths in / out), `master.db` writes, network, secrets, user-supplied paths. Otherwise: **"N/A — no security surface."**

### Assets
- … (data, secrets, attacker goal)

### Trust boundaries
- … (which layer trusts which input)

### Threats (STRIDE-light)
| ID | Threat | Mitigation in plan | Test covers |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | … | step N / file X | test_… |

### Residual risk
- ≤60 words — what cannot be eliminated, why acceptable.

## Migration Path

Stage 3 Migration-Path-Agent. Required when feature changes: DB schema, file layout, settings/config shape, IPC contract, on-disk caches, USB export bytes. Otherwise: **"N/A — no migration."**

### Before → After
- Data shape today: …
- Data shape after: …
- Existing-data handling: in-place migrate / lazy on read / one-shot backfill

### Backfill / forward-compat
- Migration script: `<file>` (or "no script — schema-additive")
- Old client reads new data: yes/no — how degraded
- Rollback: restore via `<backup>` / re-run reverse migration `<file>`

### User-visible behavior during migration
- … (downtime, progress UI, can app start before complete?)

## Performance Budget

Stage 3 Perf-Budget-Agent. Numbers, not "fast". If feature has no perceptible runtime cost: **"N/A — analysis-only / one-shot."**

| Path | Budget | Measured today | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| <e.g. POST /api/duplicates/scan> | p95 ≤ 800ms / 50MB peak | … | `tests/perf/…` or "untested" |

### Worst-case scenario
- Input shape: <e.g. 50k tracks, 200 dupes>
- Expected impact: …
- Mitigation if exceeded: …

## API / UX Surface

Stage 3 Planner-Agent. What is added / changed at every layer the user / frontend touches.

### Backend (FastAPI)
- New routes: `<METHOD> <path>` — auth: `require_session`? rate-limited? lock?
- Changed routes: `<METHOD> <path>` — what changed in request/response shape

### Frontend (React)
- New components / hooks / IPC calls (axios + invoke):
- Changed components: …

### Tauri (Rust commands)
- New `#[tauri::command]`s: …
- Changed signatures: …

### CLI / sidecar logs
- New stdout markers (e.g. `LMS_TOKEN=`-style): …

## Telemetry

Stage 3 Planner-Agent. How we know it works after ship. ≤80 words. Otherwise: **"N/A — no runtime behavior to observe."**

- Log markers (`logger.info("op=… …")`): …
- Counters / timing: …
- Health-endpoint surface: …
- User-visible status (toast, statusline, dashboard tile): …

## Test Plan

Stage 3 Test-Plan-Agent. Concrete test cases, one row per. Must cover Threat Model + Migration + Perf budgets.

| ID | Layer | Test file | Case | Covers (Threat / OQ / Step) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | py | `tests/test_<area>.py::test_<case>` | … | Threat T1 |
| T2 | rust | `src-tauri/src/audio/.../tests` | … | Step 3 |
| T3 | js | `frontend/src/**/*.test.js` | … | OQ 2 |
| T4 | integration | `tests/test_<integration>.py` | end-to-end happy path | full flow |
| T5 | perf | `tests/perf/<file>.py` (new) | p95 budget vs target | Perf table row N |

## Task Queue

<!--
Small, individually-committable implementation tasks. Written by research-plan (Stage 3),
approved by the user at the Approval Gate. research-implement works ONE task per branch:
routine/<slug>-task-<N>. 1 task = 1 feature = 1 PR. Tick - [x] when the PR is merged.
Keep tasks small — a task too big to review in one PR must be split.
Each task should map back to a Step in ## Implementation Plan and have ≥1 row in ## Test Plan.
-->

- [ ] <task — small, single-purpose, independently testable> — covers Step N, tests T<m>, T<n>

## Review

Stage 3 Reviewer-Agent (`review_`). Unchecked box or rework reason → `rework_`.

- [ ] Plan addresses all goals
- [ ] Plan matches `## Original Idea` — no scope-creep
- [ ] Open questions answered or deferred
- [ ] Prior Art referenced — no duplicated past work
- [ ] Threat Model present + each threat has a test (or N/A justified)
- [ ] Migration Path present + rollback documented (or N/A justified)
- [ ] Performance Budget set + worst-case scenario documented (or N/A justified)
- [ ] API / UX Surface enumerated for every layer touched
- [ ] Telemetry defined for shipped behavior (or N/A justified)
- [ ] Test Plan covers every Threat + every Step + every Perf row
- [ ] Task Queue items are small + independently committable + reference Steps + Tests
- [ ] Dependencies audited — new libs have Schicht-A entries
- [ ] Risk mitigations defined
- [ ] Rollback path clear
- [ ] Affected docs identified (`architecture.md`, `FILE_MAP.md`, indexes, `CHANGELOG.md`)

**Rework reasons:**
- …

## Approval Summary

Stage 3 Mockup+Summary-Agent (after Plan-Reviewer PASS). **Plain user-facing English — NOT Caveman.** This block is what the user reads to decide yes/no. ≤200 words. No `file:line` jargon — describe effects, not internals.

- **What it does:** 1–2 sentences, plain language. What the feature gives the user.
- **What you'll notice:** bullet list of user-visible effects (new button, faster scan, new export option, …).
- **Scope:** N files touched · N tasks · effort S/M/L · risk low/med/high.
- **Rollback:** one line — how it's undone if you dislike it after merge.
- **Mockup:** see `## Mockup` below.

## Mockup

Stage 3 Mockup+Summary-Agent. Adaptive to feature type — decide from `## API / UX Surface`:

- **UI feature** (has frontend components): write a self-contained static wireframe to `docs/research/mockups/<slug>.html` (inline CSS, no build step, no external assets — open in a browser locally). Fill the **UI** block below. Leave the **Backend** block empty/removed.
- **Backend / DSP / USB / DB feature** (no visible UI): fill the **Backend** block with a concrete example — sample API request/response, CLI/log output, or before→after data (metadata tags, USB tree, DB rows). Show the shape the user will actually see. Leave the **UI** block empty/removed.

### UI — mockup file
- `docs/research/mockups/<slug>.html` — <one-line layout + key-interaction description>

### Backend — concrete example
```text
<sample response / CLI output / before→after — the user-visible shape>
```

> ⛔ APPROVAL GATE — user `/approve` (→ `accepted_`) or `/reject "<reason>"` (→ `rework_`). The single sign-off: read `## Approval Summary` + `## Mockup`. After approval, nothing is re-researched.
> ↓ Stage 4 — `inprogress_`. `research-implement` builds each Task Queue item via 5 agents (Approach-Probe, Code, Standard-Review, Security-Review, Test-Coverage-Review, Doc-Sync) on a `routine/*` branch. You test + merge the branch yourself.

## PR Log

Stage 4. One row per task PR. `research-implement` appends; user notes merge after local testing.

| Task | Branch | PR | CI | Std Rev | Sec Rev | Test Cov | Doc Sync | Merged |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| … | `routine/<slug>-task-N` | #… | pass/fail | pass/fail | pass/fail | pass/fail | pass/fail | YYYY-MM-DD |

## Implementation Log

Stage 4 Code-Agent + Approach-Probe. Dated entries. What built / surprised / changed-from-plan.

### YYYY-MM-DD — Approach Probe (task N)
- Sketches considered: A (…), B (…), C (…)
- Selected: <letter> — why
- Rejected: … — why

### YYYY-MM-DD — Implementation
