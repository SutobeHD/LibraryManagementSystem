# Research & Implementation Pipeline — INDEX

Live dashboard. Each entry mirrors a file under `docs/research/{research,implement,archived}/`. Update on every `git mv`.

Format per line:
`<state>_<slug>.md — one-line hook (YYYY-MM-DD)`

If this index drifts from the file system, the file system wins — re-derive with `ls docs/research/*/`.

## How to update

When a doc changes state:
1. After `git mv` (or `mv` for new files), move its line to the new section
2. Update the date at the end of the line
3. If the file moved across stages (e.g. `research/` → `implement/`), also update the markdown link path
